# Jest Airtable Script

A Jest environment for [Airtable Scripts](https://airtable.com/developers/scripting).

## Setup & Installation

You need to install both this package and @airtable/blocks to run tests. The `@airtable/blocks` package is required by the base snapshots generated by Airtable's Testing Fixture extension.

```bash
npm install --save-dev jest-airtable-script @airtable/blocks
```

## Code of Conduct

This repository falls under [U.S. Digital Response’s Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), and we will hold all participants in issues, pull requests, discussions, and other spaces related to this project to that Code of Conduct. Please see [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) for the full code.

## Usage

Add the following to your `jest.config.js` file:

```js
{
  testEnvironment: 'jest-environment-airtable-script'
}
```

### Getting base fixture data

> [!WARNING]  
> You should generate fixture data from a copy of your base that has non-sensitive test data. You can generate fake records using the [Random record generator](https://airtable.com/marketplace/blkuZ6kbfEjCTxSNV/random-record-generator) extension.

Airtable scripts are always run within the context of a base. To test your scripts locally, you will need to generate an object that stores all the tables, fields, views, and records in your base. You can do this by using the [Test Fixture Generator extension](https://airtable.com/marketplace/blk5qI32GYyYb1Rbm/test-fixture-generator).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Test Fixture Generator extension **has a bug** that means you need to edit the output and can't just paste it into a new file.

To fix the file generated by the Test Fixture Generator extension, you need to remove the `mockSdkWithFixtureData` function and export the fixture data object directly:

```js
import { FieldType, ViewType } from '@airtable/blocks/models'
import { mockSdkWithFixtureData } from '@airtable/blocks/testing'
export default mockSdkWithFixtureData({ ...data })
```

Remove all references to `mockSdkWithFixtureData` so that you just export the fixture data object:

```js
import { FieldType, ViewType } from '@airtable/blocks/models'

export default { ...data }
```

Then you can import the fixture data in your test files:

```js
import baseFixture from './base-fixture.js'
```

### Writing tests

You will probably want to load your Airtable scripts from a separate file for testing. Here is an example of how you might do that:

```js
// my-script.js
const table = base.getTable('My Table')
output.text(table.name)
```

```js
// my-script.test.js
import fs from 'fs'
import baseFixture from './base-fixture.js'

describe('My Script', () => {
  const myScript = fs.readFileSync(__dirname + '/my-script.js', 'utf8')

  it('should output the table name', async () => {
    const result = await runAirtableScript({
      script: myScript,
      base: baseFixture,
    })
    expect(result.output[0]).toEqual('My Table')
  })
})
```

### A note on IDs

The Test Fixtures extension automatically changes IDs for tables, fields, views, and records to strings like `fldFirstName` for a "First name" field. As this envrionment is mostly designed for developing scripts that run in multiple bases, IDs should not be depended on anyhow, and table or field names should be used instead.

If you **really** need to use IDs, you can use the global `__isAirtableScriptTestEnvironment` variable to conditionally use IDs in your script:

```js
const table = base.getTable(
  globalThis.__isAirtableScriptTestEnvironment ? 'tblMyTable' : 'My Table'
)
```

### Detecting if the script is running in the test environment

When a script is running in the test environment, the global `globalThis.__isAirtableScriptTestEnvironment` is set to `true`. This can be used to conditionally run code that should only be executed in the test environment.

### Local date formats

The Date, Last updated time, and Created time fields all support multiple date formats, including "Local," which can change depending on the client. This can make it hard to test the results of a call to a records' `getCellValueAsString` method. To make this easier, you can set the `defaultDateLocale` option when calling `runAirtableScript` to specify the date format you want to use. This will set the date format for all date fields in the base.

```js
const result = await runAirtableScript({
  script: myScript,
  base: baseFixture,
  defaultDateLocale: 'us',
})
```

You can pass one of `us`, `friendly`, `european`, or `iso`.

### Results

The results from calling `runAirtableScript` are an object with several properties:

- `output`: An array of all the calls to the built-in `output` object.
- `mutations`: An array of all the changes made to the base, including creating, updating, and deleting tables, fields, and records.
- `console`: An array of all the calls to the `console` object, like `console.log`.

#### Output

The `output` property is an array of all the calls to the [built-in output object](https://airtable.com/developers/scripting/api/output). Different types of output methods return different types of items.

To persist data for test purposes, if your script calls `output.clear()`, we instead just add a new record in the output array with the contnets of the global `OUTPUT_CLEAR` variable. To test this, you can check for that variable:

```js
it('outputs one text, then clears, then another text', async () => {
  const { output } = await runAirtableScript({
    script: `
      output.text('first output')
      output.clear()
      output.text('second output')
    `,
    base: randomRecords,
  })
  expect(output).toEqual(['first output', OUTPUT_CLEAR, 'second output'])
})
```

#### Mutations: Changes to tables, fields, and records

Any changes you make to the base are recorded and returned in the `mutations` property. The following types of mutations are supported and are defined in the global `MutationTypes` object:

- `SET_MULTIPLE_RECORD_CELL_VALUES`
- `DELETE_RECORD`
- `CREATE_RECORD`
- `CREATE_FIELD`
- `UPDATE_FIELD_CONFIG`
- `UPDATE_FIELD_DESCRIPTION`
- `UPDATE_FIELD_NAME`
- `CREATE_TABLE`

Each mutation has one of the above `type` properties and an `args` property that contains the arguments passed to the method that caused the mutation.

An example of using a mutation in a test:

```js
it('creates a record', async () => {
  const { mutations } = await runAirtableScript({
    script: `
      const table = base.getTable('tblTableA')
      await table.createRecordAsync({
        fldName: 'New Name',
      })
    `,
    base: testBase,
  })
  expect(mutations[0].type).toEqual(MutationTypes.CREATE_RECORD)
  expect(mutations[0].args.cellValuesByFieldId).toEqual({
    fldName: 'New Name',
  })
})
```

#### Console

We overwrite the default `console` object in Airtable scripts to capture all calls to `console.log`, `console.warn`, and `console.error`. These are returned in the `console` property of the results object. It is structured as an array of objects that include a `type` property (one of `log`, `warn`, or `error`) and a `message` property with the message that was logged.

An example of using the console in a test:

```js
it('logs a message', async () => {
  const { console } = await runAirtableScript({
    script: `
      console.log('Hello, world!')
    `,
    base: testBase,
  })
  expect(console[0].type).toEqual('log')
  expect(console[0].message).toEqual('Hello, world!')
})
```

## Developing locally

The environment variable `JEST_AIRTABLE_TS_DEV` should be set to `true` so that the `runScript` function pulls the compiled SDK mock from the `./src/environment/sdk/__sdk.js` file. This is already set to `true` in the `package.json` file.

Note that because of the unique way that the SDK is mocked, including needing a pretty broad set of global variables being set up, there are files where some eslint rules are ignored.
